# Job Application Tracker
A secure, reliable and easy to configure job status tracker API.
## What This Application is About
This Spring Boot application helps users manage their job applications in an organized and efficient way, making it easy to retrieve and update entries quickly. It also includes social features, such as viewing trending companies that other users are applying to. The app uses a full authentication system based on JSON Web Tokens (JWT), integrated with Spring Security for secure access control. To improve performance, Redis is used to cache frequent database queries, and AWS S3 is used to store user-uploaded media files.

# Local Development Setup

Follow these steps to configure and run the application for local development.

## 1. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) installed. From the root of the project, run:

```bash
mvn install
```

This will install all required dependencies as specified in the `pom.xml` file.

## 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory. Alternatively, set the following environment variables through your IDE or terminal:

- `DB_URI`: URI of your PostgreSQL database
- `DB_USERNAME`: Your database username
- `DB_PASSWORD`: Your database password
- `JWT_SECRET`: A 256-bit hexadecimal secret for JWT generation
- `S3_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS S3 access key
- `S3_SECRET_KEY`: Your AWS S3 secret key
- `S3_BUCKET_NAME`: Name of your S3 bucket

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you rename any of the above variables, update them accordingly in `/src/main/resources/application.yml`.

## 3. Run the Application

To run locally using Maven:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## 4. Run with Docker

If you prefer a containerized setup, ensure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed. From the root of the project, build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t tracker-app .
```

Then run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 tracker-app
```
